## RN
For react native, we are not going to use create-react-native-app, since we are going to use some native libraries. Furthermore, react-native init will give us more freedom over app development.
### RN checklist
1. [ReactJS docs](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
2. [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)(we are using version 0.49)
3. [React Native debug](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
4. [Redux, a way of managing application state](https://redux.js.org/docs/basics/)
5. React styling is a bit different from other frontend framework, maybe one will need some time to adapt to it.
